## CALCULATOR

In this program, the user is prompted to enter two numbers, followed by selecting an operation. Based on the input, the program performs the desired operation and displays the result. It includes error handling for division by zero or square root of negative numbers. The program continues to run until the user chooses to quit by pressing 'Q'.

Please note that this program assumes valid inputs and does not handle all possible edge cases. It's always a good idea to include proper input validation and error handling in actual production code.
